Publish with github pages
Once you've added your project to GitHub, you can publish by going to the settings tab from your repo (this should be in the top right corner), then select pages (this should be towards the bottom left).

From here make sure you have "deploy from branch" selected and save your settings. Once saved, it should take a few minutes to generate and display your new live GitHub pages url.
